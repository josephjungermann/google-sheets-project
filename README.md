# Commuter-Adjusted Population and Revenue Analysis of LIRR Babylon Branch Routes to Manhattan

### Write your nutgraf here:

A large number of Long Islanders commute daily to Penn Station through Long Island Rail Road's Babylon branch line, effectively inflating Manhattan's daytime population while decreasing Nassau and Suffolk totals.

This phenomenon called "commuter-adjusted population," which the Census Bureau defines as "the number of people who are present in an area during normal business hours, is depicted through a snapshot of the Babylon line's ridership totals."

Make sure your pitch answers the following questions:

-   Why this story is relevant ("So what?) and why now?
-   What is the single question your story tries to answer?
-   Why will this story resonate with your audience?

What else has been done on this topic (provide links)? How is your angle different or fresh?

-   [The Most Important Population Statistic That Hardly Ever Gets Talked About (City Lab)](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2013/05/most-important-population-statistic-hardly-ever-gets-talked-about/5747/)

_My angle is different because it localizes the coverage to just Long Island and Manhattan, and uses LIRR to prove this concept of "commuter-adjusted population."_

Describe how and where you found the data with links. Put the raw data (csv, xls, pdf) in a folder called `data` in this folder, and provide a [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dI0xHC3VNH6uBt3lnpEtev1Bb2y3sxReiyiDn9MWzNI/edit?usp=sharing) to your Google Sheet. Show your data work in this Google Sheet – this could be sorting, aggregating, filtering, pivot tables, vlookups, etc.

Write up at least one or up to three findings from your analysis based on the data you found.

-   _See index.html for findings._

Who are some potential human sources you could reach out to for more info?

_Would have been helpful to reach out to MTA workers and experts who collect and process data for the MTA, LIRR and Babylon branch specifically. Also would be great to reach out to daily riders of the LIRR to add context and color to the story._

# Google Sheets Project Pitch (NEW PITCH):

## Hede: Commuter-Adjusted Population and Revenue Analysis of LIRR Babylon Branch Routes to Manhattan

### A summary of your idea or hypothesis, which explains why it is newsworthy:

A large number of Long Islanders commute daily to Penn Station through Long Island Rail Road’s Babylon branch line, effectively inflating Manhattan’s daytime population while decreasing Nassau and Suffolk totals.

This phenomenon is called “commuter-adjusted population,” and it gives us a good idea of the worker population that LI contributes to the city. We'll look at this data through the ridership totals of Long Island Rail Road's Babylon Branch for the 2019 general ledger year.

# Google Sheets Project Pitch (OLD PITCH):

## Hede: Is New York’s Bail Reform Really Leading to an Increase in Crimes?

### A summary of your idea or hypothesis, which explains why it is newsworthy:

Ever since New York State passed its controversial bail reform plan on Jan. 1, which eliminates cash bail for most misdemeanors and non-violent felonies, lawmakers and politicians from both sides of the isle have been split on the whether the policy has harmed or helped New York's judicial system.

NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio weighed in when addressing questions of an increase in crime since the start of 2020 stating, "It sort of stands out like a sore thumb that this is the single biggest new thing in the equation and we saw an extraordinary jump," per the [New York Post's Sam Raskin and Gabrielle Fonrouge](https://nypost.com/2020/02/07/de-blasio-admits-nyc-crime-jump-is-linked-to-bail-reform/).

Many state Republicans are pleading for Albany legislatures to amend the reform, pointing to specific cases that occurred after the reform was introduced (e.g. [a serial bank robber who was let free and shortly robbed another bank thereafter](https://nypost.com/2020/01/14/serial-bank-robber-suspected-in-yet-another-manhattan-heist-cops/)). But Democrats who have backed the bill are standing their ground.

New York Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie stated, "You need real data, real information, not cherry-picked stories and sensationalized events to try to paint a picture as to whether the law is working or not," per WSKG's Karen DeWitt.

I agree with Speaker Heastie that we MUST analyze the numbers in order to fairly judge the results of bail reform (or at least paint a better picture) rather than judge its effectiveness on a case-by-case basis.

### Potential concerns of this story:

New York State's Bail Reform is a fairly new piece of legislation, which means there may not be a whole lot of crime data following its implementation into the system.

That means I'd be essentially comparing years of crime statistic data to just 2-3 months of reports/data.

To be fair, I think this project would need to be an open-ended one and updated regularly throughout the semester so that people can check in with how things are going.

Another question I have is whether I should focus on the city and its five boroughs as a whole, or just focus on one community district that houses just a few precincts.

I think it would be cool, though, to try to start small and then compare to the rest of the city.
