## Hede: Is New York’s Bail Reform Really Leading to an Increase in Crimes?

### A summary of your idea or hypothesis, which explains why it is newsworthy:

Ever since New York State passed its controversial bail reform plan on Jan. 1, which eliminates cash bail for most misdemeanors and non-violent felonies, lawmakers and politicians from both sides of the isle have been split on the whether the policy has harmed or helped New York's judicial system.

NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio weighed in when addressing questions of an increase in crime since the start of 2020 stating, "It sort of stands out like a sore thumb that this is the single biggest new thing in the equation and we saw an extraordinary jump," per the [New York Post's Sam Raskin and Gabrielle Fonrouge](https://nypost.com/2020/02/07/de-blasio-admits-nyc-crime-jump-is-linked-to-bail-reform/).

Many state Republicans are pleading for Albany legislatures to amend the reform, pointing to specific cases that occurred after the reform was introduced (e.g. [a serial bank robber who was let free and shortly robbed another bank thereafter](https://nypost.com/2020/01/14/serial-bank-robber-suspected-in-yet-another-manhattan-heist-cops/)). But Democrats who have backed the bill are standing their ground.

New York Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie stated, "You need real data, real information, not cherry-picked stories and sensationalized events to try to paint a picture as to whether the law is working or not," per WSKG's Karen DeWitt.

I agree with Speaker Heastie that we MUST analyze the numbers in order to fairly judge the results of bail reform (or at least paint a better picture) rather than judge its effectiveness on a case-by-case basis.

### Potential concerns of this story:

New York State's Bail Reform is a fairly new piece of legislation, which means there may not be a whole lot of crime data following its implementation into the system.

That means I'd be essentially comparing years of crime statistic data to just 2-3 months of reports/data.

To be fair, I think this project would need to be an open-ended one and updated regularly throughout the semester so that people can check in with how things are going.

Another question I have is whether I should focus on the city and its five boroughs as a whole, or just focus on one community district that houses just a few precincts.

I think it would be cool, though, to try to start small and then compare to the rest of the city.

I'm still working on this! But I'm taking Urban as my subject concentration, and I have developed a handy beat memo of sources that will work for this story.
