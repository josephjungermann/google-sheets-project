      <h1>Commuter-Adjusted Population and Revenue Analysis of LIRR Babylon Branch Routes to Manhattan</h1>

        <p>About 2.82 million people out of Long Island's 7.56 million total population live in Nassau and Suffolk County, according to the 2010 Census Bureau. Both counties' populations combined are greater than each of New York's five boroughs
          including Manhattan's population of 1.58 million.</p>
        <p>But a large number of Long Islanders commute daily to Penn Station through Long Island Rail Road's Babylon branch line, effectively inflating Manhattan's daytime population while decreasing Nassau and Suffolk totals.</p>
        <p>This phenomenon called "commuter-adjusted population," which the Census Bureau defines as "the number of people who are present in an area during normal business hours," is depicted in the following chart based on data of a five-year study
          from the American Community Survey:</p>

        <iframe title="Population Increase Due to Commuting: 2006-10 " aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-ebl6W" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ebl6W/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
          style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="911"></iframe>
        <script type="text/javascript">
          ! function() {
            "use strict";
            window.addEventListener("message", function(a) {
              if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                  var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                  t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
                }
            })
          }();
        </script>

        <p>Though the 2020 census has yet to be completed, Babylon line's ridership numbers provide a snapshot of it's contribution to Manhattan's daily population boost.</p>
        </p>
        <p>In 2019, LIRR commuters from the Babylon branch's 13 start-points en-route to Penn Station totaled 10.75 million in ridership for the year, which averages to over 895,000 visits per month and over 29,000 visits per day to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Though we have to strongly consider margin of error when comparing LIRR 2019 numbers to 2010 census numbers, using the ACS chart above, today's Babylon branch daily riders would account for a 2% bump in Manhattan's population.</p>
        <p>That number may not sound significant, but it is considering we're looking at only one of the many LIRR branches along with other locations where commuters come from, including the surrounding boroughs and New Jersey transit.</p>
        <p>The most popular start-point route to Penn Station was Babylon with a ridership of 1.47 million people in 2019â€”or 14% of the total ridership numbers to Penn Station for the branch.</p>

        <div class="container photo">
          <img src="img/SUMRidershipChart.jpg">

          <p>Out of all the possible route combinations within the Babylon branch, ridership to Penn Station alone accounts for 59% of the total 18.28 million in ridership via the line in 2019. Not only is there a large chunk of working Long
            Islanders
            who
            travel to Penn Station and inflate Manhattan's daytime population, but a large portion of the Babylon branch's income relies on those people.</p>
          <p>There were 5.93 million Babylon-line tickets sold in 2019 and 2.85 million of those tickets (48%) that were punched had Penn Station as the final destination, totaling to approximately $94.87 million (59%) of the branch's general ledger
            revenue amount of $159.8 million for the year.</p>
          <p>As long as Nassau and Suffolk populations remain consistent, the Babylon branch should remain a key transit line in getting Long Islanders to and from the city. But continuous inflation of ticket prices and any hit to Manhattan's economy
            and
            job market could undoubtedly cap what the branch could earn in the upcoming years.</p>
