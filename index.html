        <p>About 2.82 million people out of Long Island's 7.56 million total population live in Nassau and Suffolk County, according to the 2010 Census Bureau. Both counties' populations combined are greater than each of New York's five boroughs
          including Manhattan's population of 1.58 million.</p>
        <p>But a large number of Long Islanders commute daily to Penn Station through Long Island Rail Road's Babylon branch line, effectively inflating Manhattan's daytime population while decreasing Nassau and Suffolk totals.</p>
        <p>This phenomenon called "commuter-adjusted population," which the Census Bureau defines as "the number of people who are present in an area during normal business hours," is depicted through a snapshot of the Babylon line's ridership
          totals.
        </p>
        <p>In 2019, LIRR commuters from the Babylon branch's 13 start-points en-route to Penn Station totaled 10.75 million in ridership for the year, which averages to over 895,000 visits per month and over 29,000 visits per day to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The most popular start-point route to Penn Station was Babylon with a ridership of 1.47 million people in 2019â€”or 14% of the total ridership numbers to Penn Station for the branch.</p>
        <p>Out of all the possible route combinations within the Babylon branch, ridership to Penn Station alone accounts for 59% of the total 18.28 million in ridership via the line in 2019. Not only is there a large chunk of working Long Islanders
          who
          travel to Penn Station and inflate Manhattan's daytime population, but a large portion of the Babylon branch's income relies on those people.</p>
        <p>There were 5.93 million Babylon-line tickets sold in 2019 and 2.85 million of those tickets (48%) that were punched had Penn Station as the final destination, totaling to approximately $94.87 million (59%) of the branch's general ledger
          revenue amount of $159.8 million for the year.</p>
        <p>As long as Nassau and Suffolk populations remain consistent, the Babylon branch should remain a key transit line in getting Long Islanders to and from the city. But continuous inflation of ticket prices and any hit to Manhattan's economy
          and
          job market could undoubtedly cap what the branch could earn in the upcoming years.</p>
